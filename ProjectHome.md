Web Mud Lister is a free, lightweight flat-file MUD listing service that allows anonymous web contributors to add MUDs to a list of services.  The services are polled on-demand and nightly for reliability, and after X days of consistent downtime, MUDs are moved from the active list to the MUD Graveyard.  For the first Y days, MUDs in the graveyard are
periodically checked to see if they can be revived and placed on the main list.

An easily customized HTML template was used and, against better intentions, includes a clone with attached umbilical so you can maintain a second list for "graphical" MUDs.  Some custom images were thrown in to beautify your listing but you'll have to insert them yourself when you're styling it.
